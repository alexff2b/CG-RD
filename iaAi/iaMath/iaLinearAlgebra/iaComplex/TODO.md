# TODO List for iaComplex Class

## Planned Features and Enhancements

### 1. Additional Mathematical Operations
- [ ] Implement **power** operation for complex numbers (`c1^n`).
- [ ] Implement **root extraction** for complex numbers (`n`-th root).
- [ ] Implement **exponential**, **logarithm**, and **trigonometric** functions:
  - `exp(c)`, `log(c)`, `sin(c)`, `cos(c)`, `tan(c)`, etc.

### 2. Improved I/O and Formatting
- [ ] Support parsing complex numbers from **string input** (e.g., `"3+4i"`).
- [ ] Implement formatting options for output (rectangular vs. polar form).

### 3. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize arithmetic operations for **reduced computational overhead**.
- [ ] Investigate the use of **SIMD instructions** for complex number operations.

### 4. Extended Compatibility
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with **C++ standard library complex numbers** (`std::complex`).
- [ ] Add support for **templated complex numbers** (`iaComplex<T>`, e.g., `float`, `long double`).

### 5. Testing and Debugging
- [ ] Expand unit tests for all arithmetic operations.
- [ ] Add stress tests with large-scale computations.
- [ ] Verify cross-platform consistency (macOS, Linux, Windows).

### 6. Documentation and Examples
- [ ] Improve **Doxygen documentation** for the class.
- [ ] Provide practical **examples of usage** in different scientific fields (physics, engineering, etc.).
